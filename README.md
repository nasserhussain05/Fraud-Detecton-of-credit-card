# Fraud Detection of Credit Card Transactions

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. The project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

## Overview

Fraudulent credit card transactions are a significant concern in the financial industry. This project aims to identify and prevent fraud by building and evaluating two machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression is used to create a predictive model based on historical credit card transaction data. It classifies transactions as either genuine or fraudulent.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** SVM is employed to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection by identifying complex patterns and anomalies in credit card transactions.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains anonymized credit card transaction data with features like transaction amount, time, and PCA-transformed features for security and privacy. The dataset can be found above.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fraud-Detection-of-Credit-Card.git
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Fraud_Detection.ipynb` and run the cells to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

3. Analyze the results and explore the model's performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Results

Discuss the results and performance of your machine learning models. Include any insights, visualizations, or metrics that demonstrate how well your models perform in identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
